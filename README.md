_Elephants never forget_

# Schema
The Elephant library will work only with structures which meet the following criteria:

- It has a parameter of type int64 which has the tag "id" and is unique (will be used as primary key)
- The structure can be marshalled to JSON
- The struct name meets the following regular expression: `[0-9A-Za-z_]{1,40}`
- All attributes to be saved must be public (first letter of the variable name must be uppercase)

This library will store every instance inside a table with the name of the structure. Each table will have two columns: the id (int) column and the value, which will be a JSON with, at most, 64 Kilobytes (defined by MaxStructLength)

Supported URIs, right now, follow this criteria:

- `sqlite3:path/to/file.db` (if the file doesnÂ´t exist, it will be created)
